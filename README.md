## Usage
1. Upon opening the planner app, you will see a small description and the current date and time displayed at the top of the page.

2. The scheduler displays hourly time blocks of standard business hours of 9 AM to 5 PM. Each time block contains a text area for entering tasks, events, or notes and a save button.

3. Time blocks are color-coded:
- Past hours are gray.
- Present hour (current) is red.
- Future hours are green.

4. To add a task for a specific hour, simply head on to the text area, enter your content, then clicking the "Save" button on the right. This will then be saved to your local storage area.

5. To retrieve a previously saved task, simply open the scheduler, and your tasks will be loaded automatically from the local storage.

### To see local storage...
1. Head to your web devtools which to either right click the page then hit inspect or use F12 on windows

2. There will be a small window that would open on the right side of your web and on top bar, you will then head to **Application** then you will see local storage.
